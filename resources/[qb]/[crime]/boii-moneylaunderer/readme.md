# BOII | DEVELOPMENT - UTILITY: MONEY LAUNDERER

Here we have a simple money laundering script for your city.
You can choose to wash markedbills or any item, and receive payment in either money or an item reward.
Comes with a blacklisted job list to disable legal jobs from accessing.
Any service jobs added to the service job list will force the ped to move location when in range.
Enjoy! :) 

### INSTALL ###

1) Drag and drop `boii-moneylaunderer` into your server resources
2) Add `ensure boii-moneylaunderer` to your `server.cfg`
3) Customise `shared/config.lua` & `shared/language.lua` to fit your requirements
4) Add item information under **SHARED/ITEMS.LUA** into your `qb-core/shared/items.lua` if using items provided
5) Add images provided inside `images` into your `qb-core/inventory/html/images` if using items provided
6) Restart your server

### USAGE ###
