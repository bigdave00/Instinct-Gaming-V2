# BOII | DEVELOPMENT - UTILITY: GANG LOCATIONS

Here we have a really simple script to add target locations for gangs within your city.
You can add locations for stashes, management and wardrobes to as many locations as required easily through config.
Stashes can be raided by a list of service jobs found in config.
Enjoy :)
